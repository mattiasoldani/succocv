# succocv

This is **succocv**, a LaTeX template for the creation of a Curriculum Vitae, a list of publications and a cover letter that automatically share the same (fancy) style and the same personal information. The three documents result from three different source code main files, i.e.

- `main_cv.tex`,
- `main_publications.tex` and
- `main_coverletter.tex`

respectively. All the necessary information (content and settings) must be set in these 3 files and in

- `packages_configs.tex` &mdash; some graphical and compilation settings;
- `personal_infos.tex` &mdash; most personal data;
