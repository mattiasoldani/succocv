# succocv

This is **succocv**, a [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) template for the creation of a Curriculum Vitae, a list of publications and a cover letter that automatically share the same (fancy) style and the same personal information. The three documents result from three different source code main files, i.e.

- `main_cv.tex`,
- `main_publications.tex` and
- `main_coverletter.tex`

respectively. All the necessary information (content and settings) must be set in these 3 files and in

- `packages_configs.tex` &mdash; some graphical and compilation settings;
- `personal_infos.tex` &mdash; most personal data;
- `publications.bib` &mdash; the list of publications in [BibTeX](http://www.bibtex.org/) format.

Check in the source code comments for detailes.

This project has been built starting from [moderncv](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/moderncv). An elaborate example of application should be available on [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattia-soldani/).

The succocv source code can be downloaded either as a ZIP archive, from the Code drop-down menu [here](https://github.com/mattiasoldani/succocv), or directly from the terminal (open in your project working directory) via
```shell
git clone https://github.com/mattiasoldani/succocv.git
```
Note: the latter requires  [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed on your machine.
